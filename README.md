    In a world dominated by the pandemic. Touching something that someone else may have recently touched can be a major risk to your health. Thinking about it, why not be able to open your garage door without touching anywhere? Or even if you forgot your keys somewhere but your Mi Band 3 or other Bluetooth device is with you. We will use them as access keys ...

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This sketch was created to meet a simple need: opening the garage door using my Mi Band 3. I studied several "how to's" found on Google and finally assembled this code. Several examples were analyzed and used to arrive at a functional sketch for the scenario I need. The board used was an ESP32 from M5Stack, the ATOM Lite.

### Built With

* [C]()
* [C++]()
* [Arduino IDE]()



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Check https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/ to install the Arduino IDE
Install de library for the ESP32 boards
Check https://github.com/m5stack/M5Atom and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f4biAfvC_M to install M5Stack ATOM library on Arduino IDE
Install the following libraries too: BLE (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/esp32-ble-arduino/), PubSubClient (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/pubsubclient/)
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/andrevilas/atom-doorkeeper-miband-mqtt.git
   ```
2. Open the .ino file on Arduino IDE
   ```   
3. Make your changes
   ```
4. Burn the code on the ESP32 board and go happy
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

In a pandemic season, avoid touching places that more than one person usually touches. So why not use BLE technology to trigger without touching. Or just if you forgot your keys but still have the Mi Band 3 on your wrist ...

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
